# Errorlets
Developers: Derek Coley, Grant Magdanz, Austin Bisharat

Errorlets is a library in pure Javascript that aims to make event driven programming simpler with support for streams and error handling.
The library supports sequential, event-based operations that may commonly produce errors. Errorlets allows for communicating with a server and gracefully handles errors in an async, event-based manner. Errorlets also allows for asynchronously reading a file from disk while handling errors in a sequential, easy to read manner.
